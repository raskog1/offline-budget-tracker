# offline-budget-tracker

## Description

This budget tracker application is an exercise to utilize the window indexDB feature when an application goes offline. In this situation, the user will be able to continue to track their budget with or without server connectivity. When the server goes back online, all elements that were saved into the indexDB are merged with our mongoDB database. The user does not have to worry about losing any vital information in relation to their current balance.

## Installation

Deployed application:

https://raskog1-offline-budget-tracker.herokuapp.com/

## Usage

A user can track their budget by entering expenses and income into the application. Knowing the importance of tracking a budget, internet connectivity cannot interfere with our data. That is why this application is designed to work on or offline. The user does not need to do anything when the application goes back online, and in fact, the user will typically be unaware of any interruption of service.

## Roadmap

No further advances will be made on this application.
